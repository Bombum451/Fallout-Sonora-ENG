RadMurav Team presents Fallout Sonora’s Extended Release translation to English

Originally powered by Yandex, it now boasts over 50% (thank you Georg) of its files hand-translated, and the remaning ones are being improved  all the time.

RadMurav Team is: Violator, Adolf, rockerdahedgehog, with the invaluable help of Georg, Jamesticle and Ficmon.

HOW TO
1. Get the Extended Release for FO Sonora, the original won’t work. The official version of ER is hosted in rutracker, which is where we recommend getting it from: https://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=6345851
You may also acquire it here: https://disk.yandex.ru/d/9lJlPoKayB3zIA/Fallout_Sonora_1.11%2BDLC_(Extended%20Release)_13.10.23.exe
2. Download the release files on the right side of the screen. Unpack the files inside the sonora folder and overwrite if asked to.
3. That’s it. If you see any egregious errors or bugs, either send us a message here, or look for the official threads in NMA and RPGCodex.
