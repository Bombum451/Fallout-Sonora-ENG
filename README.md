RadMurav Team is: Violator, Adolf, rockerdahedgehog, with the invaluable help of Georg and Jamesticle

HOW TO
1. Get the Extended Release for FO Sonora, the original won’t work. The official version of ER is hosted in rutracker, which is where we recommend getting it from. You may also acquire it here, but it hasn’t been tested:
https://disk.yandex.ru/d/9lJlPoKayB3zIA/Fallout_Sonora_1.11%2BDLC_(Extended%20Release)_13.10.23.exe
2. Delete or comment out the .dat files inside your install folder
3. Download the github folders and files and place them there
4. That’s it. If you see any egregious errors or bugs, either send us a message here, or look for the official threads in NMA and RPGCodex.
