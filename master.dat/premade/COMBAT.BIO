BIO:

The strongest among his
fellow residents. Thanks
to his incredible physique,
Chaves easily did twice
as much work on the
plantation as the regular
men. He has no equal in a
fistfight, especially if
he's fighting to protect
his hometown of Villa.
However, violent temper
and lack of intelligence
cemented his reputation
as somewhat limited
person. Nevertheless, he
will be able to make a
name for himself in the
harsh wastelands, unlike
any other Villa resident.
