From an early age,
Ricardo managed to
win others over with
his good looks, charisma,
and eloquence. He often
acted as a mediator
in disputes, negotiated 
trade with outsiders,
and entertained his
community with
performances. Although
of little use in other
matters, the skill of
diplomacy will be
indispensable for 
survival while wandering
the Wastelands.
