BIO:

A silent, quiet
and very inconspicuous
resident of the Villa.
What was on his mind
was always difficult
to understand, even to
people he considered
close. His aloofness has
become the subject of
ridicule and rancour,
but Ramon skillfully
turned these traits to
his own benefit and
that of the whole Villa,
by engaging in
exploration and foraging.
If anyone can survive
away from home, it's him.
