BIO:

A talented, but most
stubborn resident of
the Villa. From an early
age, Selma loved reading
and learning about
pre-war technology.
However, the community
considers her knowledge
questionable at best,
and instead demanded
from her the usual
duties expected from a
woman - raising children,
cooking, and housekeeping.
Becoming a teacher was
the most she could hope
for. But now, the time
has come for Selma to
prove them all wrong.
